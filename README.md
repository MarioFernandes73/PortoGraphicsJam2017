# Porto Graphics Jam 2017
Game made for Porto Graphics Jam 2017


Name: Journey


Theme: Trip


Idea: A spiritual trip done by the protagonist in which he was faced with choices along the way: he could solve his problems either with violence or with logic. During his journey, the protagonist remembers certain aspects of his life and makes a retrospective of his past actions. Upon reaching the end he faces off his biggest fears and anxiety and can choose to destroy them or embrace them. After this stage, the game ends with an appropriate ending considering his choices during this trip.


Missing components of the presented version (due to time shortage): another way to solve each stage rather than killing the monsters, story depth and polish, stages polish such as preventing the protagonist to advance without killing every monster or solving the (unimplemented) puzzles, some small fixes such as protagonist texture appearing under the car from time to time.
